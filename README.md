# MOGG Exploder
### by Ryan Monro

### Instructions

- install ffmpeg and ffprobe: the easiest way is [install Homebrew](https://brew.sh), then go to Terminal and type `brew install ffmpeg`
- drag MOGG Exploder into /Applications, or thereabouts
- open a MOGG file with MOGG Exploder (right click -> Open With... -> All Applications -> find MOGG Exploder...)
- it will create a directory on your Desktop and gradually fill it with all the goodies

### Problems
- this won't work with all MOGG files: if ffprobe can't read it, then neither can MOGG Exploder. It turns out Reaper knows how to open a lot of MOGG files that ffprobe scratches its head about. If anyone knows the format pretty well please get in touch. At time of writing it only works with Beatles Rock Band MOGG files. But that's pretty handy.

### Coming soon
- dragging and dropping files onto MOGG Exploder
- support for more MOGG files
